![TypeScript definition](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript%20Definition-%E2%9C%93-blue.svg)

Tartare is a JavaScript testing framework which uses
[BDD/Gherkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development#Behavioural_specifications)
and [DDT] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_testing) to describe your tests.
It is fully **code driven** since all your testing stuff is in your code.

Tartare is based on the popular [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) framework providing you with a new Gherkin *ui* and
a couple of Gherkin *reporters*, among other goodies.

## Install
Tartare is available as an NPM module.

```bash
$ npm install -g tartare
```


## Describe your tests
When using Gherkin to describe tests, each test is called a **scenario**, and several related *scenarios* are grouped
inside a **feature**. Then those *scenarios* are described in term of its pre-conditions, the event that triggers
the test, and the expected outcomes or post-conditions. Pre-conditions are described with the **given** keyword,
while events and post-conditions are described with the keywords **when** and **then**, respectively. You can also
use the keywords **and** and **but** if your test needs more than one pre-condition, event, or post-condition.
Each one of those descriptions are generically known as **steps**.

When using Tartare, you can describe you tests using those keywords:

```javascript
feature('Addition', function() {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {
    given('I have entered 50 into the calculator', function() {

    });
    and('I have entered 70 into the calculator', function() {

    });
    when('I press add', function() {

    });
    then('the result should be 120 on the screen', function() {

    });
  });
});
```

The `feature` function accepts a variable number of string arguments between the *feature* description and the
function. Those all arguments may be used to give more information about the *feature*, such as the User Story related
to the *feature*, o some kind of additional information.

```javascript
feature('Addition',
        'In order to avoid mistakes',
        'As a user that needs to do math calculations',
        'I want to be helped out to calculate additions',
        function() {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {

    [...]

  });
});
```

### Filling in the steps
It's time to tell your *steps* what to do. Simply write your code inside each *step* function.

It is not a good idea to put a lot of code inside each *step*. For the sake of clarity it is always better
to put your complex code in a separated module, exporting the needed functions, and using them from the
main test file. Let's call this module your **step library**.

If you are using synchronous code, simply write it inside the callback function.

```javascript
var steps = require('./steps-library');

feature('Addition', function() {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {
    given('I have entered 50 into the calculator', function() {
      steps.enterNumberSync(50);
    });

    [...]

  });
});
```

If your code is asynchronous, add a callback function (usually named `done`) to the *step* function, and invoke
that callback when the *step* is complete. This callback understand the common `(err, res)` pattern so it can
be directly used as your function's callback.

```javascript
var steps = require('./steps-library');

feature('Addition', function() {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {
    given('I have entered 50 into the calculator', function(done) {
      steps.enterNumber(50, done);
    });

    [...]

  });
});
```

And what if you need to call more than an asynchronous function in a single *step*? It would look like this:

```javascript
var steps = require('./steps-library');

feature('Addition', function() {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {
    given('I have entered 50 into the calculator', function(done) {
      steps.clearField(function(err, res) {
        if (err) {
          return done(err);
        }
        steps.enterNumber(50, done);
      });
    });

    [...]

  });
});
```

To avoid the *callback hell*, Tartare provides you with the function `synchronize` which applied to a module,
wraps all the exported functions so that they can be invoked as synchronous code.

```javascript
var steps = require('./steps-library');
synchronize(steps);

feature('Addition', function() {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {
    given('I have entered 50 into the calculator', function() {
      steps.clearField();
      steps.enterNumber(50);
    });

    [...]

  });
});
```

Note that the wrapped functions can still be invoked asynchronously if called with a callback.

If you include synchronous functions in your *step library*, prevent `synchronize` from being applied to them
by adding an attribute named `dontSync` with a truthy value.

```javascript
var enterNumberSync = function enterNumberSync(number) {
  // Your cool code here
}
enterNumberSync.dontSync = true;

module.exports = {
  enterNumberSync: enterNumberSync;
}
```

## Run your tests
Once you have coded your tests in a file named `calculator-tests.js` run Tartare:

```bash
$ tartare calculator-tests.js
```

Or to run tests in a directory and its subdirectories:
```bash
$ tartare --recursive tests
```

Tartare will run your tests writing to the console a coloured output that shows the descriptions of the *features*,
*scenarios* and *steps*, the execution duration at several levels, and a summary with some stats and metrics
about your test suite.

![Gherkin reporter output](http://telefonicaid.github.io/tartare/img/gherkin-reporter.png)

This output is generated by the so-called Gherkin reporter. See more about the available reporters [below](#reporters).


## Data Driven Testing - Variants
The concept of Data Driven Testing basically means that a single *scenario* is executed several times using
different input data. In our calculator example, we could run the *scenario* to test the *Add* function with
different numbers.

Tartare *scenarios* accept an extra argument with the set of data to be used in each *scenario* execution.
This argument must be an array of objects, each one containing the properties to be used in each *scenario* execution.
Each one of these objects is named a **Variant**.
Then the *scenario* function will be invoked as many times as there are *variants* in the array, passing the *variant*
object to the *scenario* function as an argument.

If you include a string property named `desc` in each *variant*, it will be used by the reporters to title
the *variant*.

```javascript
var steps = require('./steps-library');
synchronize(steps);

feature('Addition', function() {
  var dataset = [
    {desc: 'one digit', number1: 1, number2: 3, result: 4},
    {desc: 'two digits', number1: 50, number2: 70, result: 120}
  ];
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', dataset, function(variant) {
    given('I have entered ' + variant.number1 + ' into the calculator', function() {
      steps.clearField();
      steps.enterNumber(variant.number1);
    });

    [...]

  });
});
```

Such a *scenario* produces the following output when the test suite is run:

![Gherkin reporter output when using variants](http://telefonicaid.github.io/tartare/img/gherkin-reporter-variants.png)


## Hooks
**Hooks** are useful to set up and tear down your tests. Sometimes you need things to happen but it makes no sense
to take part of the *steps*. For example, you may need to start the [SUT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_under_test)
but it makes no sense to put it as part of a *given step*, and it only need to be done once at the beginning
of the *feature*. The following is the list of the available *hooks* and where can they be used:

| *Hook* name                            | Usage                                     |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| beforeAll/afterAll                   | Top level (outside *features*)            |
| beforeFeature/afterFeature           | Inside *features* and outside *scenarios* |
| beforeEachScenario/afterEachScenario | Inside *features* and outside *scenarios* |
| beforeScenario                       | Inside *scenarios*                        |
| beforeEachVariant/afterEachVariant   | Inside *scenarios*                        |


*Hooks* behave as *steps*, understanding both synchronous and asynchronous code.

```javascript
var steps = require('./steps-library');

feature('Addition', function() {
  beforeFeature(function(done) {
    steps.startCalculator(done);
  });

  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {
    given('I have entered 50 into the calculator', function(done) {
      steps.enterNumber(50, done);
    });

    [...]

  });

  afterFeature(function() {
    steps.closeCalculator();
  });
});
```

## Reporters
Tartare comes with two built-in reporters:
* **gherkin**: a console reporter that outputs a coloured description of your *features*, *scenarios* and *steps*.
* **gherkin-md**: a Markdown reporter to upload the test description and results to GitHub.

Tartare also allows you to define third-party reporters. See [below](#third-party-reporters) for more information.

### gherkin
This is the default reporter. It prints the *feature*, *scenario* and *step* descriptions while they are being
executed. It uses different symbols and colours for passed and failed *steps*, and prints the time taken by
*steps*, *variants*, *scenarios*, *features*, and the whole suite to be executed.

At the end it prints some stats about the *features*, *scenarios*, *variants* and *steps* your suite has, and how many
of them have passed or failed, or how many are marked as [manual](#manual-tests). It also gives you some metrics
about your suite. Keep in mind that *features* having the same description are counted as the same *feature*.
This means that you can split *features* without affecting the stats.

In the case that some *steps* have failed (due to runtime errors or unfulfilled assertions), this reporter prints
the list of failures together with their details. When an assertions fails, the exact output depends on the
assertions library you have used.

Finally, this reporter prints some warnings about *variants* that are marked as bugs but are not failing, or
*variants* that are failing but are not marked as bugs, just to help you to [manage your bugs](#bug-management).

Note that this reporter can use two colour themes: one for consoles with a dark background, and another one
for clear backgrounds. You can set the theme to be used setting the value `dark` or `clear` to the
`TARTARE_THEME` environment variable, or by passing the `--theme` argument to the CLI.
Tartare defaults to the dark theme.

```bash
$ TARTARE_THEME=clear tartare tests.js
$ tartare tests.js --theme clear
```

### gherkin-md
When choosing the Markdown reporter, stats and test description is produced by using the [GFM (GitHub Flavored
Markdown)](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). This reporter do not actually execute
the test suite, but only reads all your *features*, *scenarios*, *variants* and *steps* to generate the report, so
you get the report in a fraction of a second.

This reporter puts the stats at the very beginning, followed by a TOC that links to each *feature* and *scenario*
in the report. Then a pretty test description is printed and finishes with a list of all the marked bugs,
which are links to the related *variant*.

As in the case of the [gherkin report](#gherkin), *features* with the same description are counted as the same *feature*.

By default, the report is written to the stdout, so you would want to redirect it to a file:

```bash
$ tartare tests.js --reporter gherkin-md > report.md
```

But you can use the `output` reporter option to set the file where the report will be written:

```bash
$ tartare tests.js --reporter gherkin-md --reporter-options output=report.md
```

You can also use the `bugidLink` reporter option to set the base URL of your bug tracking system
(see [Bug Management](#bug-management) below):

```bash
$ tartare tests.js --reporter gherkin-md --reporter-options output=report.md,bugidLink=http://bugtrackingsystem/
```

![Markdown reporter output](http://telefonicaid.github.io/tartare/img/markdown-reporter.png)

### Third party reporters
Tartare also allows you to define third-party reporters by using npm modules. Simply install the reporter package
from npm (`npm install my-cool-reporter`) and use the option `--reporter my-cool-reporter`.


## Running only selected tests
You can mark *features* or *scenarios* to be executed alone by using `.only`.

```javascript
feature.only('Addition', function() {

    [...]

});

feature('Multiplication', function() {

    [...]

});
```

Only the first *feature* will be executed.

```javascript
feature('Addition', function() {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {

    [...]

  });
  scenario.only('Add two real numbers', function() {

    [...]

  });
});
```

Only the second *scenario* will be executed.

You can also execute a single *variant* by adding an `only` property to the *variant* object with a truthy value.

```javascript
feature('Addition', function() {
  var dataset = [
    {only: true, desc: 'one digit', number1: 1, number2: 3, result: 4},
    {desc: 'two digits', number1: 50, number2: 70, result: 120}
  ];
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', dataset, function(variant) {

    [...]

  });
});
```

If needed, you can use `only` in several *features*, *scenarios* or *variants* and only the marked ones will be executed.

## Skipping tests
*Features*, *scenarios* and *variants* can also be marked with `.skip`/`skip: true` and they will be completely excluded
from execution. It works the same as commenting out the skipped tests: they don't appear on the reports nor are
counted on stats.

```javascript
feature('Addition', function() {
  var dataset = [
    {desc: 'one digit', number1: 1, number2: 3, result: 4},
    {skip: true, desc: 'two digits', number1: 50, number2: 70, result: 120}
  ];
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', dataset, function(variant) {

    [...]

  });
  scenario.skip('Add two real numbers', function() {

    [...]

  });
});
```

## Manual tests
Although sometimes we have to do manual testing, that doesn't mean that your manual tests don't appear on
the report. Simply describe your manual tests without passing a function, and they will appear on the report tagged
as manual tests.

```javascript
feature('Addition', function() {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {
    given('I have entered 50 into the calculator');
    and('I have entered 70 into the calculator');
    when('I press add');
    then('the result should be 120 on the screen');
  });
});
```

In you want to mark *features*, *scenarios* or *variants* as manual tests even when their *steps* are implemented
you can use `.manual`/`manual: true`.

```javascript
feature('Addition', function() {
  var dataset = [
    {desc: 'one digit', number1: 1, number2: 3, result: 4},
    {manual: true, desc: 'two digits', number1: 50, number2: 70, result: 120}
  ];
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', dataset, function(variant) {

    [...]

  });
  scenario.manual('Add two real numbers', function() {

    [...]

  });
});
```

Note that marking a *variant* as manual, its parent *scenario* and *feature* are automatically marked as manual, even
when they may have implemented tests, and they are counted as manual on stats.


## Bug management
In order to help you to manage bugs, Tartare allows you to mark *features*, *scenarios* and *variants* as minor or major
bugs. When some of your tests detects a bug, it fails (because their assertions fail). Then you can mark the test
as a major bug to assign it with a bug id from your bug tracking system, and it will be printed on the report.
It also prevents the report from warning about failing tests that are not marked as bugs.

Sometimes a bug has a very low relevance and you don't want the buggy test to count as failed, while you still
want to track the bug. In those cases, mark the test as a minor bug and, in addition to assigning it with a bug id,
it won't be executed (to avoid the failure) and will count as passed on stats. Hooks belonging to a test marked as
minor bug won't be executed either.

To mark *features* and *scenarios* as bugs, use the methods `majorBug('bugId')` or `minorBug('bugId')` where `bugId`
is a string.

```javascript
feature('Addition', function() {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {

    [...]

  }).majorBug('id-359');
  scenario('Add two real numbers', function() {

    [...]

  }).minorBug('id-459');
});
```

You can also mark *variants* as minor or major bugs by including the `majorBug` or `minorBug` properties whose values
will be a string.

```javascript
feature('Addition', function() {
  var dataset = [
    {majorBug: 'id-359', desc: 'one digit', number1: 1, number2: 3, result: 4},
    {minorBug: 'id-459', desc: 'two digits', number1: 50, number2: 70, result: 120}
  ];
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', dataset, function(variant) {

    [...]

  });
});
```

When using the [markdown reporter](#gherkin-md) you can pass the `bugidLink` reporter option with the base URL of
your bug tracking system, so the bug ids will be links formed by appending the bug id passed to the
`majorBug`/`minorBug` functions to the base url. If such a base url has the `%s` placeholder,
the bug id will be placed there.

```bash
$ tartare tests.js --reporter gherkin-md --reporter-options output=report.md,bugidLink=http://bugtrackingsystem/%s
```

## Tags and filters
You can assign *features*, *scenarios* and *variants* with tags, understood as simple short strings, that help you
to organize, categorize, or whatever your tests. The goal of tagging tests is to use filters in order to
select tests to be executed. Using `only` is a very simple way of filtering, but tags gives you more choices.

Assign tags to *features* or *scenarios* by using the method `tag(tags)` where `tags` can be a string,
an array of strings, or several string arguments, allowing you to assign more that one tag. To assign tags
to a *variant*, include the `tag` property whose value can be a string or an array of strings.

```javascript
feature('Addition', function() {
  var dataset = [
    {tag: 'important', desc: 'one digit', number1: 1, number2: 3, result: 4},
    {tag: ['reviewed', 'regression'], desc: 'two digits', number1: 50, number2: 70, result: 120}
  ];
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', dataset, function(variant) {

    [...]

  }).tag('smoke');
  scenario('Add two real numbers', function() {

    [...]

  }).tag('smoke', 'new');
});
```

Once you have tagged your tests, choose what to execute using the `--filter` argument. You can pass a single
tag to the `filter` parameter and only tests tagged with that tag will be executed.

```bash
$ tartare tests.js --filter smoke
```

Or you can execute all the tests except those tagged as "smoke" by adding a hyphen before the tag.

```bash
$ tartare tests.js --filter -smoke
```

Your can also combine several tags with AND and OR operators, using the characters `&` and `|`, respectively.

```bash
$ tartare tests.js --filter "new&-smoke"
$ tartare tests.js --filter "reviwed|important"
```

And even you can use parenthesis to indicate precedence.

Note that tags can only contain uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and underscore.

Also note that `only`, `skip`, `manual` and `bug` are reserved and cannot be used as tags. It is because Tartare
automatically tags tests when you use `.only`/`only: true`, `.skip`/`skip: true`, `.manual`/`manual: true` and
`minorBug('bugId')`/`minorBug: 'bugId'`/`majorBug('bugId')`/`majorBug: 'bugId'`, so you can filter by buggy tests,
or manual tests.

```bash
$ tartare tests.js --filter manual
$ tartare tests.js --filter -bug
```

## CLI arguments

```
  Usage: tartare [options] [files]

  Options:

    -h, --help                              output usage information
    -V, --version                           output the version number
    -r, --require                           require the given module
    -R, --reporter <name>                   specify the reporter to use [gherkin]
    -O, --reporter-options <k=v,k2=v2,...>  reporter-specific options
    -t, --timeout <ms>                      set test timeout in milliseconds [10000]
    -f, --filter <filter_str>               run only tests matching <filter_str>
    -c, --colors                            force enabling of colors
    -C, --no-colors                         force disabling of colors
    --theme (dark|clear)                    set the color theme to be used with the gherkin reporter [dark]
    --no-interactive                        disable interactive features
    -B, --no-bail                           prevent from bailing after first step failure
    --no-exit                               require a clean shutdown of the event loop: Tartare will not call process.exit
    --no-timeouts                           disables timeouts
    --recursive                             include sub directories
    --reporters                             display available reporters
```

#### -r, --require
This option is useful to load modules before executing the test suite. Since the required modules are not
assigned to any variable, it works with modules that modify prototypes or add properties to the
`global` object.

#### -R, --reporter
Allows you to specify the reporter that will be used, defaulting to *[gherkin](#gherkin)*.

#### -t, --timeout
Specifies the *step* or *hook* timeout (in milliseconds), defaulting to 10 seconds. If a *step* or *hook* does not
finish before this timeout, it is considered as failed.

#### -f, --filter
Allows you to specify a [filter](#tags-and-filters) to select what tests to run.

#### --theme
When using the default *gherkin* reporter, this options allows you to choose the color theme. It can take the value
`dark` (default) for consoles with a dark background, or `clear` for consoles with a clear background.

#### --no-interactive
Disable interactive features such as printing step descriptions during their execution, reprinting the line once
the step has finished with the final result and duration. This kind of features uses the console in a way that may not
work properly on some console emulators.

#### -B, --no-bail
By default, Tartare stops the test suite after the first failure. If you want Tartare to execute the whole suite,
reporting all the failures at the end, use this option.


## Changing the timeout programmatically
If you need to change the timeout passed through the `-t, --timeout` argument for a specific *feature*, *scenario*,
*step*, or *hook*, invoke `this.timeout(20000)` passing the new timeout in milliseconds.

```javascript
feature('Addition', function() {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {
    given('I have entered 50 into the calculator', function() {
      this.timeout(20000);  // This step will take more than 10 seconds
      steps.enterNumberVerySlowly(50);
    });

    [...]

  });
});
```

Your can also get the current timeout invoking `this.timeout()`.

## Other goodies
Tartare augments the `String` and `RegExp` objects with useful methods not available in ECMAScript 5:
* `String.prototype.startsWith(substr [, position])`: determines whether a string begins with the characters
  of another string, returning `true` or `false`, beginning at the provided position (defaults to 0).
* `String.prototype.endsWith(substr [, position])`: determines whether a string ends with the characters
  of another string, returning `true` or `false`. If a position is provided, the string will be considered
  to have that length.
* `String.prototype.repeat(count)`: Returns a string which contains the the specified number of copies of the
  string on which it was called.
* `RegExp.escape(str)`: Returns the string passed as argument where each character that has a special meaning
  in a regular expression has been escaped (preceded by `\`).

So when using Tartare you can do the following:

```javascript
'string'.startsWith('str'); // => true
'string'.endsWith('ing');   // => true
'copyme'.repeat(5);         // => 'copymecopymecopymecopymecopyme'
RegExp.escape('(a+^)$*/'); // => '\\(a\\+\\^\\)\\$\\*\\/'
```

Tartare provides you with some handy global functions:
* `sleep(ms)`: it is a "synchronized" version of `setTimeout` that can be used inside *steps* and *hooks* as
  synchronous code.

```javascript
  given('I have entered 50 into the calculator', function() {
    steps.enterNumber(50);
    sleep(200);
  });
```

* `getTartareOptions([optionName])`: Every argument passed to the Tartare CLI that is not recognized by Tartare as
  an own option can be queried using this function, or if it is called without arguments an object containing all
  the options is returned. It also works for environment variables starting with `TARTARE_`. CLI arguments are
  converted to its lowerCamelCase form, removing the leading hyphens, while environment variables starting with
  TARTARE_ are converted to its lowerCamelCase form, removing the leading TARTARE_ and considering each underscore
  as a word separator. Thus the following options are equivalent and their values can be retrieved by invoking
  `getTartareOptions('myCoolVariable')`:

```bash
$ TARTARE_MY_COOL_VARIABLE=foo tartare tests.js
$ tartare tests.js --my-cool-variable foo
```

* `synchronize(module)`: As explained [above](#filling-in-the-steps), this function wraps the functions exported by
  a module so they can be invoked as synchronous functions from inside *steps* and *hooks* (they can still be invoked
  as asynchronous functions if invoked with a callback). It only works with function following the CPS pattern
  (with a callback as the last argument) and you can prevent a function from being "synchronized" by adding a
  property named `dontSync` with a truthy value to the function.

* `promisize(module)`: this function wraps the functions exported by a module into a promise and insert them
  into the Selenium Control Flow. See more about using Tartare with Protractor and Selenium
  [here](#testing-web-apps-with-tartare--protractor).
  It only works with function following the CPS pattern and you can prevent a function from being
  "promisized" by adding a property named `dontPromisize` with a truthy value to the function.


## Using Tartare programmatically
In addition to running Tartare from the command line, you can also use it programmatically.

```javascript
var Tartare = require('tartare'),
    fs = require('fs');

// First, instantiate a Tartare instance
var tartare = new Tartare();

// Then, use the method "addFiles" to tell Tartare what files to run
var files = fs.readdirSync('tests').filter(function(file) {
    // Keep only the .js files
    return file.endsWith('.js');
});
tartare.addFiles(files);

// Now, run the tests!
tartare.run(function(failures) {
  process.on('exit', function() {
    process.exit(failures);
  });
});
```

You can set Tartare options when instantiating the Tartare object.

```javascript
var tartare = new Tartare({
  timeout: 5000,
  reporter: 'gherkin-md',
  filter: 'regression'
});
```

The whole list of supported options is:
* `reporter`: reporter name, defaults to `gherkin`.
* `reporterOptions`: reporter-specific options. It can be an object or a string with a list of key=value pairs separated by commas.
* `timeout`: timeout in milliseconds.
* `bail`: bail on the first *step* failure.
* `filter`: expression to filter tests with.
* `useColors`: set whether colors can be used on console reporters.
* `theme`: set the color theme to be used with the gherkin reporter (dark or clear).
* `interactive`: enable interactive features.
* `enableTimeouts`: enable timeouts.
* Any other options will be available through the `getTartareOptions` function.

You can also use the following environment variables: `TARTARE_REPORTER`, `TARTARE_REPORTER_OPTIONS`, `TARTARE_TIMEOUT`,
`TARTARE_BAIL`, `TARTARE_FILTER`, `TARTARE_USE_COLORS`, `TARTARE_THEME`, `TARTARE_INTERACTIVE`, `TARTARE_ENABLE_TIMEOUTS`.

The `addFiles` method accepts both a string (a single file) or an array of strings.

Note that you can access to the underlying Mocha object through `tartare.mocha`.


## Testing web apps with Tartare + Protractor
You can use Tartare as a testing framework with [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor) in order to
describe your tests using the Gherkin syntax while taking advantage of Protractor to test AngularJS applications.

Firstly, install both Protractor and the [Protractor Tartare Framework](https://github.com/telefonicaid/protractor-tartare)
using `npm`:

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev protractor protractor-tartare tartare
```

Note that you still need Tartare as a dependency.

Then you have to set `custom` as the testing framework in the Protractor config file and set the path to the
Protractor Tartare Framework. You can also pass options to Tartare with `tartareOpts`.

```javascript
  framework: 'custom',
  frameworkPath: require.resolve('protractor-tartare'),
  tartareOpts: {
    reporter: 'gherkin',
    timeout: 15000
  }
```

In order to make easier the usage of functions following the CPS pattern (with a callback) when using Protractor,
Tartare provides you with the `promisize` function. This function, when applied to a module, wraps all the
exported functions into promises and insert them into the
[WebDriver Control Flow](https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/control-flow).

Consider you have a module with a exported CPS function:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  myCoolFn: function myCoolFn(foo, bar, cb) {
    [...]
  }
};
```

After "promisizing" this module, the function can be used as any other Protractor function, such as `element` or
`browser`.

```javascript
var steps = require('./steps-library');
promisize(steps);

feature('Addition', function() {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', function() {
    given('I have entered 50 into the calculator', function() {
      browser.get('http://...');
      element(by.model('text')).sendKeys('abc');;
      steps.myCoolFn('foo', 'bar');
    });

    [...]

  });
});
```

You can prevent `promisize` from being applied to a function by adding an attribute named `dontPromisize`
with a truthy value.

```javascript
var myCoolFn = function myCoolFn() {
  // Your code here
}
myCoolFn.dontPromisize = true;

module.exports = {
  myCoolFn: myCoolFn
}
```

Tartare also augments the WebDriver promises with a `get` method that allows to access object's properties
and array's elements for promises objects or arrays. It takes an argument that specify a dotted path of
property names or indexes and returns a promise that resolves to the specified property or element.
This may be used to assert some condition over an object property or an array element when such an object
or array are WebDriver promises (a function wrapped with `synchronize` returns this kind of promises).

Consider that you have a promise named `myPromise` that resolves to this object:

```javascript
  {
    list: [33, 'foo'],
    bar: true
  }
```

Now you want to make an assertion over the second element of the `list` property, using the
[chai-as-promised](https://github.com/domenic/chai-as-promised/) library:

```javascript
expect(myPromise.get('list.1')).to.eventually.equal('foo');
```

## Using Tartare with TypeScript  
Tartare comes with bundled typings. You just need to write your tests like so:

```ts
import 'tartare';

feature('Addition', () => {
  scenario('Add two natural numbers', () => {
    given('I have entered 50 into the calculator', () => {

    });
    and('I have entered 70 into the calculator', () => {

    });
    when('I press add', () => {

    });
    then('the result should be 120 on the screen', () => {

    });
  });
});
```

You can use Tartare along with [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) in order to
compile TypeScript on the fly. Install ts-node as a dependency and run Tartare with the flag
`--require ts-node/register`.

```bash
$ tartare --require ts-node/register calculator-tests.ts
```
